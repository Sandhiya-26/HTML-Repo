    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>“Success does not come to you, you go to it.” This is exactly how I look at my success. My definition of success is being happy and doing what you love. The only way I can achieve this goal is by receiving an education, saving money, and picking a career path that I will enjoy. </p>
